# What?

Generate boilerplate for the python/poetry/django/heroku project.

Why no coockiecutter? To try out a "process" approach instead of "template" approach.

In the example subdir there is a project generated using the scripts. In commits.txt there is a dump of commits made there.

## How to use

Change workdir into where you want new project root to be. Run everything.sh.
